        <h2>Lyrics by MUSIXMATCH</h2>
        <!-- I am trying out the <pre> element to keep the format of the lyrics, I couldn't get the first line to forgo the indentation. -->
        <p> <pre> It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's ten o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep telling me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend, baby, now and then
Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake?
Smelling like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
But while in this world
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I aim low, I aim true and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish that I could go along, babe, don't get me wrong
You know, you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait
Until that day
I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me </pre> </p>
